## Getting Started

This section will guide you on how to set up and run the Incident Management System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* [Python X.Y or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [pip (Python package installer)](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
* [Specify any other dependencies like database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), etc.]

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME]
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Set up the database:
    * [Provide instructions on how to configure the database. This might involve creating a database, setting up environment variables, etc.]
    * For example (if using Django):
        ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
        ```

5.  Create a superuser (for Django projects):
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    [Follow the prompts to create an admin user.]

6.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (or the specified port).

## Usage

This section explains how to use the Incident Management System.

### User Roles

[Describe the different user roles in your system and their basic functionalities. For example: Reporters, Assignees, Administrators.]

* **Reporters:** [What can reporters do?]
* **Assignees:** [What can assignees do?]
* **Administrators:** [What can administrators do?]

### Core Functionalities

[Detail the main features of your system and how to use them. Provide clear steps and examples.]

* **Creating Incidents:** [Explain how to create a new incident, what information is required, etc.]
* **Viewing Incidents:** [Explain how users can view lists of incidents and individual incident details.]
* **Assigning Incidents:** [Explain how incidents can be assigned to specific users or teams.]
* **Updating Incident Status:** [Explain how the status of an incident can be changed (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed).]
* **Adding Comments/Notes:** [Explain how users can add comments or notes to incidents.]
* **Searching and Filtering:** [Explain how users can search and filter incidents based on different criteria.]
* [Add more functionalities as needed]

## API Endpoints

[If your system has an API, list the key endpoints and their basic functionality. You can use a table for better readability.]

| Endpoint                      | Method | Description                                          | Authentication |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `/api/incidents/`            | GET    | List all incidents (requires authentication)         | [Auth Type]    |
| `/api/incidents/`            | POST   | Create a new incident (requires authentication)        | [Auth Type]    |
| `/api/incidents/{id}/`       | GET    | Retrieve a specific incident (requires authentication) | [Auth Type]    |
| `/api/incidents/{id}/`       | PUT    | Update a specific incident (requires authentication) | [Auth Type]    |
| `/api/incidents/{id}/`       | DELETE | Delete a specific incident (requires authentication) | [Auth Type]    |
| `/api/users/`                | GET    | List all users (admin only)                          | [Auth Type]    |
| [Add more API endpoints]      |        |                                                      |                |
